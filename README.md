## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This has been called the "silver tsunami".

## Results
- There are 72,458 employees that fall into the range of employees ready for retirement. This is based on a birthdate between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955, and we have excluded the employees that have already left Pewlett-Hackard.

- There are 50,842 in senior positions ready for retirement, and that is 70% of the total.
